_Original Script by [Knaxel](https://github.com/knaxel)_

I changed it a bit to allow for map hiding on **two** scenes (for multi-streaming on Tiktok and Twitch at the same time).

## How to Use:

- Download and Install [Aitum Vertical Plugin](https://aitum.tv/download/vertical/) for OBS (This will allow you to have a second, vertical scene for Tiktok)
- Setup both scenes and create a Map Cover Image in each one
- Install the Script (RustMapHider.py) in OBS Tools > Scripts > +
- Fill in the Fields on the right (Both Scene Names, Both Overlay Image Names)
- Set a Reveal Delay (Default 0.11) -> If the Map is showing on Stream, increase the delay
- Set the Hotkey (OBS Settings > Hotkeys > Rust Map Cover) to the Key that opens your Map ingame (Default "G")

### F\*ck the Snipers!
